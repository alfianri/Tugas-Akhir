   abstract = {We present an interpretation of Inception modules in con-volutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outper-forms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

   abstract = {Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.},

Most such deep learning architectures or networks are applied on RGB color space image data set, so our objective is to study DCNNs performance in other color spaces. We describe the design of our novel experiment and present results on whether deep learning networks for image recognition task is invariant to color spaces or not. In this study, we have analyzed the performance of 3 popular DCNNs (VGGNet, ResNet, GoogleNet) by providing input images in 5 different color spaces(RGB, normalized RGB, YCbCr, HSV , CIE-Lab) and compared performance in terms of test accuracy, test loss, and validation loss. All these combination of networks and color spaces are investigated on two datasets- CIFAR 10 and LINNAEUS 5. Our experimental results show that CNNs are variant to color spaces as different color spaces have different performance results for image classification task.</p>},

Unlike normal facial expression, drowsiness is defined to be a condition of exhaustion, where the expression of the face is different from usual. The important steps in detecting drowsiness are face detection and expression detection. Many algorithms are being developed to detect face and expressions. But these algorithms give poor performance due to the extrinsic parameters of the environment. Light and position of the camera are the major problems. In this paper, different architectures were used to analyse the performance of face and drowsiness detection. Also we have proposed new detection methods using deep learning techniques. To estimate the drivers' state we use facial regions corresponding to the entire face. The algorithms employed for face detection are i) Viola Jones ii) DLib iii) Yolo V3. For the Classification, The CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture employed in the drowsiness detection is modified LeNet.},

Service operators usually count the amount of passengers manually using a hand counter. Nowadays, in an era that most of human-things are digital, this method is certainly consuming enough time and energy. Therefore, this research is proposed so the service operator doesn't have to count manually with a hand counter, but using an image processing with You Only Look Once (YOLO) method. This project is expected that people counting is no longer done manually, but already based on computer vision. This Final Project uses YOLOv4 that is the latest method in detecting untill 80 classes of object. Then it will use transfer learning as well to change the number of classes to 1 class. This research was done by using Python programming language with various platforms. This research also used three training data scenarios and two testing data scenarios. Parameters measured are accuration, precision, recall, F1 score, Intersection of Union (IoU), and mean Average Precision (mAP). The best configurations used are learning rate 0.001, random value 0, and sub divisions 32. And the best accuration for this system is 69% with the datasets that has been trained before. The pre-trained weights have 72.68% of accuracy, 77% precision, and 62.88% average IoU. This research has resulted a proper performance for detecting and counting people on public transportations.},

   abstract = {The use of face video information for driver fatigue detection has received extensive attention because of its low cost and non-invasiveness. However, the current vehicle-mounted embedded device has insufficient memory and limited computing power, which cannot complete the real-time detection of driver fatigue based on deep learning. Therefore, this paper designs a lightweight neural network model to solve this problem. The model includes object detection and fatigue detection. First, a lightweight object detection network is designed, which can quickly identify the opening and closing states of the driver’s eyes and mouth in the time series video.

However, the current vehicle-mounted embedded device has insufficient memory and limited computing power, which cannot complete the real-time detection of driver fatigue based on deep learning.

First, a lightweight object detection network is designed, which can quickly identify the opening and closing states of the driver’s eyes and mouth in the time series video.

   abstract = {One of the causes of driving accidents is driver fatigue. Driver fatigue can be measured by the level of sleepiness of the driver. In this study, a deep learning model was developed to detect sleepiness in drivers. The model will detect images of the eyelids and yawning state of the driver. The driver's level of sleepiness was grouped into not sleepy, sleepy and very sleepy. The developed model consists of a feature extractor in the form of several CNN layers, and a predictor in the form of FCN. CNN is able to extract features in the image so that it can provide better accuracy at the prediction stage. The model successfully learns from data and is able to detect driver sleepiness. The accuracy of the model reaches 0.932%. The failure of the model in detecting is caused by the wrong angle of taking the image to capture the front face. It is hoped that for the next research the number of datasets will be increased by all angles of image taking.},

   abstract = {Drowsiness detection (DD) has become a relevant area of active research in biomedical signal processing. Recently, various deep learning (DL) researches based on the EEG signals have been proposed to detect fatigue conditions. The research presented in this paper proposes an EEG classification system for DD based on DL networks. However, the proposed DD system is mainly realized into two procedures; (i) data acquisition and (ii) model analysis. For the data acquisition procedure, two key steps are considered, which are the signal collection using a wearable Emotiv EPOC+ headset to record 14 channels of EEG, and the signal annotation. Furthermore, a data augmentation (DA) step has been added to the proposed system to overcome the problem of over-fitting and to improve accuracy. As regards the model analysis, a comparative study is also introduced in this paper to argue the choice of DL architecture and frameworks used in our DD system. In this sense, The proposed DD protocol makes use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implemented using the Keras library. The results showed a high accuracy value (90.42%) in drowsy/awake discrimination and revealed the efficiency of the proposed DD system compared to other research works.},

Kemampuan SOM dalam melakukan pemetaan terhitung cukup valid dan rendah bias, karena mengkalkulasi secara mandiri dan cepat berdasarkan kesamaan ciri atau karakter data yang diinput. Pada penelitian ini SOM diterapkan untuk pemetaan industi pada industri mesin pertanian dan kehutanan. Mengingat selama ini kekuatan industri mesin pertanian dan kehutanan dengan kode Kelompok Lapangan Usaha Industri (KLUI) 2921 belum dipetakan dengan sempurna. Data industri yang menjadi input pada program terlebih dahulu ditransformasi dengan aktivasi sigmoid biner dan selanjutnya dimasukkan ke dalam program jaringan competitive kohonen. Berdasarkan perhitungan metode SOM dihasilkan klasifikasi industri dengan jenis menengah dan besar dengan capaian epoch 1000. Kata kunci: Data Science; Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Self Organizing Mapping (SOM); Klasifikasi Industri. Abstract Artificial Neural Network (ANN), as an analytical method in data science, has capabilities in classification, association, self-organizing and optimization. With this capability, the ANN can create a pattern of knowledge through self-regulation or self-organizing ability and map data sets based on the similarity characteristics that exist in the data with the Self Organizing Mapping (SOM) mechanism. SOM's ability to perform mapping is considered valid and low bias because it calculates independently and quickly based on the similarity of characteristics or characters of the input data. This study applied SOM for industrial mapping in the agricultural and forestry machinery industry. Given that so far, the strength of the agricultural and forestry machinery industry with the code Industrial Business Field Group (KLUI) 2921 has not been mapped perfectly. The industrial data input to the program is first transformed by binary sigmoid activation and then entered into a Kohonen competitive network program. Based on the calculation of the SOM method, industrial classifications are produced with medium and large types with 1000 epoch achievements.},

Abstract-Traffic sign recognition (TSR) is one of the most important background research topics for enabling autonomous vehicle driving systems. Autonomous driving systems require special handling of input data: there is no time for complex transformations or sophisticated image processing techniques, they need a solid and real-time analysis of a situation. This challenge get more difficult to meetin a city like environment where multiple traffic signs, ads, parking vehicles, pedestrians, and other moving or background objects make the recognition much more difficult. While numerous solutions have been published , solutions are tested on autoways, countryside , or at a very low speed. In this paper, we give a short overview on main problems and known strategies to solve these problems, and we give a general solution to tackle real-time issues in urban traffic sign recognition.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical properties of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) depend on the mixing ratio of its binders, normal weight aggregate (NWA), and lightweight aggregate (LWA). To characterize the relation between various concrete components and the mechanical characteristics of LWAC, extensive studies have been conducted, proposing empirical equations using regression models based on their experimental results. However, these results obtained from laboratory experiments do not provide consistent prediction accuracy due to the complicated relation between materials and mix proportions, and a general prediction model is needed, considering several mix proportions and concrete constituents. This study adopts the artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling the complex and nonlinear relation between constituents and the resulting compressive strength and elastic modulus of LWAC. To construct a database for the ANN model, a vast amount of detailed and extensive data was collected from the literature including various mix proportions, material properties, and mechanical characteristics of concrete. The optimal ANN architecture is determined to enhance prediction accuracy in terms of the numbers of hidden layers and neurons. Using this database and the optimal ANN model, the performance of the ANN-based prediction model is evaluated in terms of the compressive strength and elastic modulus of LWAC. Furthermore, these prediction accuracies are compared to the results of previous ANN-based analyses, as well as those obtained from the commonly used linear and nonlinear regression models.},

ABSTRACT = {Drowsiness is a major risk factor for road safety, contributing to serious injury, death, and economic loss on the road. Driving performance decreases because of increased drowsiness. In several different applications, such as facial movement analysis and driver safety, blink detection is an essential requirement that is used. The extremely rapid blink rate, on the other hand, makes automatic blink detection an extremely challenging task. This research paper presents a technique for identifying eye blinks in a video series recorded by a car dashboard camera in real time. The suggested technique determines the facial landmark positions for each video frame and then extracts the vertical distance between the eyelids from the facial landmark positions. The algorithm that has been proposed estimates the facial landmark positions, extracts a single scalar quantity by making use of Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), and identifies the eye closeness in each frame. In the end, blinks are recognized by employing the modified EAR threshold value in conjunction with a pattern of EAR values in a relatively short period of time. Experimental evidence indicates that the greater the EAR threshold, the worse the AUC&rsquo;s accuracy and performance. Further, 0.18 was determined to be the optimum EAR threshold in our research.},

ABSTRACT = {Drowsiness-related car accidents continue to have a significant effect on road safety. Many of these accidents can be eliminated by alerting the drivers once they start feeling drowsy. This work presents a non-invasive system for real-time driver drowsiness detection using visual features. These features are extracted from videos obtained from a camera installed on the dashboard. The proposed system uses facial landmarks and face mesh detectors to locate the regions of interest where mouth aspect ratio, eye aspect ratio, and head pose features are extracted and fed to three different classifiers: random forest, sequential neural network, and linear support vector machine classifiers. Evaluations of the proposed system over the National Tsing Hua University driver drowsiness detection dataset showed that it can successfully detect and alarm drowsy drivers with an accuracy up to 99%.},

abstract = {Fatigue and workplace sleepiness are consequences of modern industrial society. Fatigue is a complex biological phenomenon that occurs as a function of time awake, time-of-day, workload, health, and off-duty lifestyle. Fatigue is a function of two major biological factors – the homeostatic drive for sleep and circadian rhythm of sleepiness. The greatest cause of fatigue is insufficient or disrupted sleep. Excessive sleepiness in the workplace and on highways is a serious safety hazard, and insufficient or disrupted sleep results in numerous accidents and adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Evidence-based strategies that promote better sleep and optimize work/rest schedules can mitigate the impact of fatigue and sleep loss. Proper nap and sleep scheduling, work breaks, modeling and monitoring tools, fatigue detection technologies, and pharmacological countermeasures can be implemented at home and/or in the workplace to reduce performance and safety hazards. Education about obtaining adequate sleep, the dangers of fatigue in terms of both health and cognitive consequences, and the availability of scientifically-proven sleep-enhancement and alertness-management strategies is essential.}

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence that acquires knowledge by training a neural network. It has many applications in the field of banking, automobile industry, agriculture, and healthcare industry. Deep learning has played a significant role in solving complex tasks related to computer vision, such as image classification, natural language processing, and object detection. On the other hand, optimizers also play an intrinsic role in training the deep learning model. Recent studies have proposed many deep learning models, such as VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, and ImageNet. In addition, there are many optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, AdaDelta, Adabelief, and AdaMax. In this study, we have selected those models that require lower hardware requirements and shorter training times, which facilitates the overall training process. We have modified the Adam based optimizers and minimized the cyclic path. We have removed an additional hyper-parameter from RMSProp and observed that the optimizer works with various models. The learning rate is set to minimum and constant. The initial weights are updated after each epoch, which helps to improve the accuracy of the model. We also changed the position of the epsilon in the default Adam optimizer. By changing the position of the epsilon, it accumulates the updating process. We used various models with SGD, Adam, RMSProp, and the proposed optimization technique. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective in achieving the accuracy and works well with the state-of-the-art architectures.},
